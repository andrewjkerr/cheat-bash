# cheat-bash

A collection of bash scripts to download markdown files from a git repository and display them in `man`.

Inspired by https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat.

## Installation

2. `bash "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewjkerr/cheat-bash/master/install.sh)"``

## Example Cheatsheets

You can find example cheatsheets at https://github.com/andrewjkerr/cheatsheets.

## To-Do

1. A better update mechanism. Currently you must auto update :(
2. Create better example cheatsheets
3. Add opts to `cheat` script
